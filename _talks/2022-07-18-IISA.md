My first presentation of a research publication, really excited!

I presented the Dimensioning Workbench tool, which is a tool that I co-developed along with my research coleagues for the DIASTEMA research project. The tool is used to dimension the resources of a cloud application based on its requirements and the available resources of the cloud provider, through a user friendly interface.
