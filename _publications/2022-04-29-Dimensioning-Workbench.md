With the exponential growth in data generated
every year, Big Data has become one of the core research
subjects in the overall computing domain. But when considering
Big Data scenarios in a cloud-centric environment, the need for
a resource management mechanism is of vital importance.
Under those circumstances, intelligent allocation of resources
can have a direct and noticeable impact on application
performance. The aim of this paper is to present a solution on
dynamic resource allocation for efficient cloud scalability. This
is made possible by using machine learning algorithms as well
as user feedback, in order to generate an adequate resource
forecasting model. The efficiency of the tool is evaluated by
repeatedly executing extensive analysis of various datasets
provided by the end-users, exploiting the cloud computing
paradigm for their analytic purposes. The given solution is able
to learn and enhance its knowledge graph considering user
feedback, as well as previously executed processes in our cloud
environment. To this extent, the forecasting model will attempt
to estimate optimal resource allocation for each user scenario.
