Big Data has proved to be vast and complex, without being efficiently
manageable through traditional architectures, whereas data analysis is considered
crucial for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Current analytics
platforms are siloed for specific domains, whereas the requirements to enhance their
use and lower their technicalities are continuously increasing. This paper describes
a domain-agnostic single access autoscaling Big Data analytics platform, namely
Diastema, as a collection of efficient and scalable components, offering user-
friendly analytics through graph data modelling, supporting technical and non-
technical stakeholders. Diastemaâ€™s applicability is evaluated in healthcare through a
predicting classifier for a COVID19 dataset, considering real-world constraints.
